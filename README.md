## Self-host
This bot is hosted on Heroku, meaning: 

‚Ä¢ It is not self-hosted.  
‚Ä¢ We will not help with self-hosting. The support server is for Catbot support only.  
‚Ä¢ You cannot use the same name or icon. This is in violation of our copyright laws.  
‚Ä¢ We won't stop you trying to self-host, feel free to, but we won't help you if you need help or mess up.  

With this being said, you're free to self-host this if you know what you're doing but we won't provide support for this specific area.
